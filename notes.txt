Writing Django Tests

    Types of Tests

    1. Unit Tests - Verify functional behaviour of individual componnts, often to class and funtional level
    2. Regression tests - Tests that reproduce historic bugs. Each test initially run to verify that the bug has been fixed, and then re-run to verify that the bug has not been re-introduced following later changes to the code.
    3. Integration tests - Verify how groupings of components work when used together. Integration tests are aware of the required interractions between components, but not necessarily of the internal operations
                           of each component. They may cover simple groupings of components through to the whole website.
    

    What does Django Provide for testing?

    Django provides a test framework with  a small hierachy of classes that build on the python standard unittest library.
